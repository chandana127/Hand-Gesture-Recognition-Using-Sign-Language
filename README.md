# Hand-Gesture-Recognition-Using-Sign-Language

The project is about recognizing  the gesture of the person and producing the output in the form of text which will be in human language.
Our objective is when a picture or photo is uploaded, to recognize the gesture and transform it in to natural processing language so that it can be understood by all the humans.And when a text is uploaded to determine the meaning of the text and show the gesture for the same.
Using Convolution Neural Network and image classification we determine the gesture.
